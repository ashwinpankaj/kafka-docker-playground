	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: true

ðŸ”˜ tibco.username



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: The username used when connecting to TIBCO EMS.
	 - Required: HIGH

ðŸ”˜ tibco.password

The password used when connecting to TIBCO EMS.

	 - Type: PASSWORD
	 - Default: [hidden]
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

==========================
ðŸ”˜ jms.destination.name

The name of the JMS destination (queue or topic) to read from.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: true

ðŸ”˜ jms.destination.type

The type of JMS destination, which is either `queue` or `topic`.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: QUEUE
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ batch.size

The maximum number of records that a connector task may read from the JMS broker before writing to Kafka. The task holds these records until they are acknowledged in Kafka, so this may affect memory usage.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 1024
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ max.pending.messages

The maximum number of messages per task that can be received from JMS brokers and produced to Kafka before the task acknowledges the JMS session/messages. If the task fails and is restarted, this is the maximum number of JMS messages the task may duplicate in Kafka. This is typically set larger than ``batch.size``. A smaller value than ``batch.size`` limits the size of the batches.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 4096
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ max.poll.duration

The maximum amount of time each task can build a batch. The batch is closed and sent to Kafka if not enough messages are read during the time allotted. This helps limit connector lag when the JMS queue/topic has a lower throughput.

	 - Type: INT
	 - Default: 60000
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ jms.receive.block.duration

Maximum time in milliseconds a JMS receive call will be blocked. Setting this value helps in reducing the number of empty receive calls, the call will be blocked until the task receives a message. This value could be in the range of 5000 milliseconds to 1800000 milliseconds

	 - Type: LONG
	 - Default: 5000
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ character.encoding

The character encoding to use while receiving the message.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: UTF-8
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ jms.subscription.durable

Whether the subscription of the connector tasks to a JMS topic is durable or not. Durable subscriptions require a subscription name to be set via ``jms.subscription.name``. 

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ jms.subscription.name



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: The name of the JMS subscription. Supported only in durable subscriptions (``jms.subscription.durable = true``) and is applicable only to JMS topics.
	 - Required: MEDIUM

ðŸ”˜ jms.message.selector



	 - Type: false
	 - Default: STRING
	 - Importance: The `message selector <http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/jms/Session.html#createConsumer(javax.jms.Destination, java.lang.String, boolean)>`_ that should be applied to messages in the destination.
	 - Required: HIGH

==========================
Retry
==========================
ðŸ”˜ max.retry.time

The maximum total time in milliseconds the connector will retry when receiving a retriable exception. This value must be at least 100 milliseconds if retry functionality is desired. If a value of less than 100 milliseconds is configured, it will be assumed that no retry functionality is desired.Additionally, some retriable exceptions will require establishing a new JMS session

	 - Type: LONG
	 - Default: 3600000
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

==========================
Kafka
==========================
ðŸ”˜ kafka.topic

The name of the Kafka topic where the connector writes all records that were read from the JMS broker.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: true

ðŸ”˜ use.permissive.schema

Whether to use a more permissive schema with an optional messageID in the key and value. Defaults to ``false`` for compatibility with the old strict schema. If your JMS messages have null message IDs, then you must set this to ``true``.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

==========================
null
==========================
ðŸ”˜ key.converter.converter.type

How this converter will be used.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: true

ðŸ”˜ key.converter.converter.encoding

The name of the Java character set to use for encoding strings as byte arrays.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: UTF-8
	 - Importance: HIGH
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ value.converter.converter.type

How this converter will be used.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: null
	 - Importance: LOW
