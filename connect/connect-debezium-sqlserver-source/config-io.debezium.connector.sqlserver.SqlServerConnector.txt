	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ snapshot.mode

The criteria for running a snapshot upon startup of the connector. Select one of the following snapshot options: 'initial' (default): If the connector does not detect any offsets for the logical server name, it runs a snapshot that captures the current full state of the configured tables. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the transaction log.; 'initial_only': The connector performs a snapshot as it does for the 'initial' option, but after the connector completes the snapshot, it stops, and does not stream changes from the transaction log.; 'schema_only': If the connector does not detect any offsets for the logical server name, it runs a snapshot that captures only the schema (table structures), but not any table data. After the snapshot completes, the connector begins to stream changes from the transaction log.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: initial
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ snapshot.isolation.mode

Controls which transaction isolation level is used and how long the connector locks the captured tables. The default is 'repeatable_read', which means that repeatable read isolation level is used. In addition, type of acquired lock during schema snapshot depends on `snapshot.locking.mode` property. Using a value of 'exclusive' ensures that the connector holds the type of lock specified with `snapshot.locking.mode` property (and thus prevents any reads and updates) for all captured tables during the entire snapshot duration. When 'snapshot' is specified, connector runs the initial snapshot in SNAPSHOT isolation level, which guarantees snapshot consistency. In addition, neither table nor row-level locks are held. When 'read_committed' is specified, connector runs the initial snapshot in READ COMMITTED isolation level. No long-running locks are taken, so that initial snapshot does not prevent other transactions from updating table rows. Snapshot consistency is not guaranteed.In 'read_uncommitted' mode neither table nor row-level locks are acquired, but connector does not guarantee snapshot consistency.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: repeatable_read
	 - Importance: LOW

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: bytes
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ schema.name.adjustment.mode

Specify how schema names should be adjusted for compatibility with the message converter used by the connector, including: 'avro' replaces the characters that cannot be used in the Avro type name with underscore; 'avro_unicode' replaces the underscore or characters that cannot be used in the Avro type name with corresponding unicode like _uxxxx. Note: _ is an escape sequence like backslash in Java;'none' does not apply any adjustment (default)

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: none
	 - Importance: LOW

	 - Default: 1024
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ incremental.snapshot.allow.schema.changes

Detect schema change during an incremental snapshot and re-select a current chunk to avoid locking DDLs. Note that changes to a primary key are not supported and can cause incorrect results if performed during an incremental snapshot. Another limitation is that if a schema change affects only columns' default values, then the change won't be detected until the DDL is processed from the binlog stream. This doesn't affect the snapshot events' values, but the schema of snapshot events may have outdated defaults.

	 - Type: BOOLEAN
	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ data.query.mode

Controls how the connector queries CDC data. The default is 'function', which means the data is queried by means of calling cdc.[fn_cdc_get_all_changes_#] function. The value of 'direct' makes the connector to query the change tables directly.

	 - Type: STRING
	 - Default: function
	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ streaming.fetch.size

Specifies the maximum number of rows that should be read in one go from each table while streaming. The connector will read the table contents in multiple batches of this size. Defaults to 0 which means no limit.

	 - Importance: LOW
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ schema.history.internal.store.only.captured.databases.ddl

	 - Default: false
	 - Importance: MEDIUM
	 - Required: false

ðŸ”˜ column.propagate.source.type
